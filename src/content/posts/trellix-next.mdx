## the useOptimistic hook

good

- very easy to implement in a next project
- very good for stuff like user settings
- can be used to fix some situations where you would want to use useEffect (hacky)

bad

- not suited for highly dynamic ui
- it does not batch by default in next
- due to transitions it does not block, but it also means that performing a lot of updates can take more time than the user uses the app which causes data loss

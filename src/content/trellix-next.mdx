Trellix Next is a project heavily inspired by [Ryan Florence's tweet](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1765179463497892117) about building an optimistic kanban board.
My goal was to recreate the core functionality displayed in the [original Trellix demo](https://trellix.fly.dev/) built in remix using Next's new server actions, server components and the useOptimistic API.

## Current state of the project

Trellix Next currently implements the following features:

1. sign in with GitHub
2. creation of boards
3. creation, deletion and editing of columns
4. creation, deletion and editing of tasks within columns
5. drag and drop for tasks inside and between columns

This closely resembles the original demo. A few insignificant features are missing.
For example being able to change the name of the board, or authentication with username/password.
I believe these features do not add significant value to the demo.

## Next 14's new patterns

Of course the entire demo was built to demonstrate the new features Next and React have to offer.
Optimistic updates were a key highlight of this project, and we'll explore them in depth towards the end of this post.
Furthermore the new patterns that I used were server actions (with transitions) and server components (with Suspense).

### Server components

Server components allow you to write async JavaScript code that runs on the server and returns React components.
This is incredible for writing data fetching code because you don't have to wait for the client side JS to hydrate before fetching data.

An example of this would look something like this:

```tsx
async function UsersList() {
  const users = await db.query.users.findMany()

  return (
    <div>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <div key={user.id}>{user.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

All this code runs on the server and is returned as static html once the fetch request is done, and the JSX is rendered.
This is the data fetching pattern that I've used throughout the entirety of the project.
For example for getting the currently logged in user, and all the boards that the user has created.

This is especially powerful when combined with `Suspense` which is a new feature as well which allows for loading states.
`Suspense` is needed because the above code actually blocks the server until the data is ready. This can result in a poor user experience.

`Suspense` fixes this by showing you a loading state until the async component is ready.

```tsx
function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={'loading...'}>
      <UsersList />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

The `Suspense` pattern really makes the app feel instant, even though the data is not there when the UI is shown.

### Server actions

Server actions are the natural counterpart to server components. They are used to send data from the client to the server.
This is done in a way similar to traditional RPC calls. They are just functions that you can call from the client.

An example of this looks like this:

```tsx
//auth/actions.ts
'use server'

type Payload = { username: string; password: string }

export async function signinAction(payload: Payload) {
  return await signin(payload)
}
```

```tsx
//auth/signin-button.ts
import { signinAction } from './actions'

export function SigninButton() {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        signinAction({ username: 'test', password: 'test' })
      }}
    >
      Sign in
    </button>
  )
}
```

Like server components, the `signinAction` code runs on the server.
Unlike server components, server actions do not block the client. They are able to do all work in the background, allowing client interactions to continue.

However, sometimes a blocking behavior or loading state is necessary to show user feedback.
This is where transitions come in, they allow you to show a loading state while the server action is running.

```tsx
import { signinAction } from './actions'
import { useTransition } from 'react'

export function SigninButton() {
  const [pending, startTransition] = useTransition()

  return (
    <button
      disabled={pending}
      onClick={() => {
        startTransition(async () => {
          await signinAction({ username: 'test', password: 'test' })
        })
      }}
    >
      {pending ? 'loading...' : 'Sign in'}
    </button>
  )
}
```

This is all the code needed to show a loading state while the server action is running.
It cleans up a lot of cumbersome loading state which is easy to get wrong and has a lot of edge cases.

It can be seen in on the signin button in the demo as well.

## Optimistic updates

The entire board UI is built with optimistic updates in mind.
This means that no matter how slow your connection is, the UI will always feel very snappy.
An example can be seen below.

  className="bg-[#ECECEE] dark:bg-[#040308]"
  width={1362}
  height={844}
  darkSrc="https://uqvgufujds.ufs.sh/f/JOQEpvAAv0nIoXDcpjBUiy8fvJ2X7sw3TSVrRMIqdAlZYQkn"
  lightSrc="https://uqvgufujds.ufs.sh/f/JOQEpvAAv0nIZw7LIw6fUChn5dkBrKLqVwcQAtbsuYJegNTm"
/>

Although this could be done on the client, it would break the single source of truth.
If this interaction was built with a more traditional approach of using `useState`, there is no clear source of truth whenever the user is changing the board around.
This can lead to synchronisation issues which in turn also means data loss.

Say for example, that the user is dragging a task while their connection drops.
This would mean that the app is now in a state where the server and the client are out of sync.
This should be resolved by updating the client, which is difficult with traditional `useState` approaches.

The `useOptimistic` hook on the other hand is a very easy way to solve this problem.
It basically acts as the `useState` hook but falls back to it's default value whenever it changes.
This means that the client is always in sync with the server, because all client state gets thrown out whenever the server state changes.

### The good and bad of useOptimistic

While using `useOptimistic` in building this project, I've found that it has the upsides I have already discussed.
It is very easy to implement in Next, it is incredible for making sure that your server is always the source of truth.
And it makes very hard client problems disappear with a single hook and a way better data loading pattern via server components.

However, there are also several downsides using `useOptimistic`.
I would say that it sadly does not live up to what I expected it to be. It is not really suited for a highly dynamic UI like the kanban board in Trellix Next.
This is because actions are not batched by default, this is an exercise left to the developer.
This means that every update to the board (action) triggers a new request which in turn updates the db and the client via the rsc payload.
The behavior becomes a problem when the user is performing a lot of actions in a short amount of time.
For example with Trellix.

Although it does not inherently cause any data loss because it does correctly send all the actions in sequence.
It does mean that whenever the user closes their tab before all the actions are done, the ones that are still in the queue are lost.

## Conclusion

In the end, I have to say that I'm very happy with the result of Trellix Next.
It taught me a lot about the new transitions and optimistic APIs in React.

I do have to say however that even though a lot of the new patterns are nice to work with, they are not a all-around solution.
Each framework will need to integrate a lot of these features into their own APIs to make them work well.

We can already see this with Next's `loading.tsx` file which is basically a route level `Suspense` boundary.
I can say that `useOptimistic` still needs a lot of love from framework authors to be the best it can be.

Until then, I'd suggest to wait a few seconds before closing Trellix Next ðŸ‘€.
